# Large Language Models Exploration

## Overview

This project explores large language models (LLMs) from two prominent model families: Llama and Phi. The primary goal is to generate text using these models, analyze the generated outputs, and build a comprehensive understanding of some of the strengths and limitations of LLMs.

## Objectives

- Generate text using Llama and Phi models.
- Analyze the quality, coherence, and relevance of the generated outputs.
- Identify strengths and limitations of LLMs in various contexts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (list libraries such as `transformers`, `torch`, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baharehgl/LLM.git
